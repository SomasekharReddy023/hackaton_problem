Title: Machine Learning - Core Knowledge

**Overview:**
Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from data without explicit programming.

**Key Areas:**
- **Supervised Learning:** Classification, regression.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering, dimensionality reduction.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Agent-based learning via rewards.
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks and advanced architectures.

**Required Skills:**
- Python (NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Probability & Statistics.
- Linear Algebra and Calculus basics.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

**Applications:**
Recommendation systems, fraud detection, speech recognition, medical diagnosis.
